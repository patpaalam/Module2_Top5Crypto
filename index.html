        <h3>What is Hedera Hashgraph(HBAR)?</h3>
        <p>
          Hedera is the most used, sustainable, enterprise-grade public network
          for the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses
          to create powerful decentralized applications (DApps).<br />
          <br />
          It is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates
          some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face —
          such as slow performance and instability.<br />
          <br />
          It was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018
          and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later
          in September 2019. As part of the ICO, investors were able to purchase
          the platform’s native utility token (HBAR) at the lowest possible
          pricing.<br />
        </p>
        <h4>Why HBAR?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>It's unique, uses Hashgraph instead of Blockchain</li>
          <li>Owns Patents to it's protocol</li>
          <li>Cheap and fast transactions</li>
